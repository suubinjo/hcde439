      <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
      <p>
        I work at a smart home company, and the CIO wants me to prototype a new visualization using a variable resistance sensor in a voltage divider.

      <p>
        For this assignment, I used a capacitive touch sensor as the input and a servo motor as the output. All grounds in the circuit are shared. A piece of aluminum foil is connected to the receive pin, which acts as the touch pad, and a 1MΩ resistor is placed between the send pin and receive pin. <br> Since the CapacitiveSensor library uses a high value resistor between the send pin and the receive pin to detact small changes in capacitance, I chose 1MΩ resistor which was the largest available resistor in my kit.

      <h3>CIRCUIT</h3>
      <p>
        I made a prototype that senses a touch using a piece of aluminum foil and moves a servo motor in response to the detected touch.

      <p> From serial measurements, the sensor values were approximately 50-70 when not touched and 800-900 when touched. I chose a touch threshold as 300 from there to avoid false touches because it is safely above the max idle noise (70).
      </p>
      <pre><code>
// include at least two libraries
#include <CapacitiveSensor.h>
#include <Servo.h>

// 1M resistor between pins 4 & 2, pin 2 is sensor pin, add a foil
CapacitiveSensor cs_4_2 = CapacitiveSensor(4,2);
// create a servo object
Servo myservo;

// set the touch detection threshold value
const long touchThreshold = 300

void setup() {
  // disable the automatic calibration of the capacitive sensor
  cs_4_2.set_CS_AutocaL_Millis(0xFFFFFFFF);
  Serial.begin(9600); // monitor sensor value
  myservo.attach(9); // attach the servo motor to PMW pin
}

void loop() {
  // read the current capacitive touch sensor value
  long sensorValue = cs_4_2.capacitiveSensor(30);

  // check whether the sensor value indicates a touch
  if (sensorValue > touchThreshold) {
    // move the servo to 180 degrees when a touch is detected
    myservo.write(180);
  } else {
    // move the servo back to 0 degrees when not touched
    myservo.write(0);
  }
  // print the current sensor value
  Serial.println(sensorValue);
  // add a short delay to reduce jitter and slow down updates
  delay(20);
}

      <h3>ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS</h3>
      <h4>
        1: Say you are using a servo motor you attach to pin 9. In your loop() you have the following code:
        <pre><code>
            void loop() {
            for (pos = 0; pos <= 180; pos +=1) {
                myservo.write(pos);
                delay(100);
                }
            }
        </code></pre>
        Draw a graph with the x-axis as time and the y-axis as voltage at pin 9 with respect to ground.

        2: Your input device is slightly broken, leading it to give us an erroneous reading 1% of the time. How can we address this? Answer in (pseudo)code.
      </h4>

      </p>
      <h4>
        3: Your input device is slightly noisy, leading the measurement to randomly deviate from the true measurement up or down by 10%. How can we address this? Answer in (pseudo)code.
