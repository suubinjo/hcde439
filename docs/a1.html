    <h1>Sue Jo's Assignment 1: Blink!</h1>
    <section id="Overview">
      <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
      <p>I work for a holiday light company, and the cheif innovation officer wants me to come up with a new pattern of blinking lights - 3 LEDs or more! </p>

      <p>
        I used a 220Ω for each red LED.

      <pre><code>
        // the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board

  // initialize three LEDs as an output.

      <h3>ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS</h3>
      <h4>
        1: Draw a graph where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage across the LEDs. Draw a line for each of your 3 LEDs.
      </h4>
      <h4>
        2: How many LEDs could you blink independently with your Arduino? How much current would that draw?
      </h4>
      <h4>
        3: How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking?
      </h4>
      <h4>
        4: Did you use AI tools in completing this assignment? If yes, please provide details on how/when, as well as a brief reflection. If no, you can either leave this question blank, or provide other information if you'd like.
