    <h1>Sue Jo's Assignment 1: Blink!</h1>
    <section id="Overview">
      <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
      <p>
        I work for a holiday light company, and the cheif innovation officer asked me to design a new blinking pattern using at least three LEDs.

      <p>
        For this assignment, I used three red LEDs (2V) and its own resistor so that each LED can be controlled independently. I used a 220Ω resistor for each LED. <br><br> Here's my calculation: <br> V_R = V_pin - V_LED = 5V - 2V = 3V <br> I = V_R / R = 3V / 0.02A = 150Ω <br><br> And then I rounded it up to 220Ω resistor which was provided in the kit.

      <h3>ARDUINO</h3>
      <p>Below is my Arduino code snippet. I used the built in example "Blink" provided by Arduino and edited it to control three LEDs independently. (Source: <a href="https://docs.arduino.cc/built-in-examples/basics/Blink/">https://docs.arduino.cc/built-in-examples/basics/Blink/)</a>
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        // the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize three LEDs as an output.
  pinMode(11, OUTPUT); // first LED
  pinMode(8, OUTPUT); // second LED
  pinMode(5, OUTPUT); // third LED
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(11, HIGH);  // turn the first LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(11, LOW);   // turn the first LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(8, HIGH);  // turn the second LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(8, LOW);   // turn the second LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(5, HIGH);  // turn the third LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(5, LOW);   // turn the third LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                    // wait for a second
}

      <h3>ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS</h3>
      <h4>
        1: Draw a graph where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage across the LEDs. Draw a line for each of your 3 LEDs.
      </h4>
      <img src="graph.jpeg" />
      <p>
        When the red LED is on, the voltage across it is 2V, and when it's off, the voltage is 0V. The LEDs blink one at a time. for 1 second each in sequence.
      </p>
      <h4>
        2: How many LEDs could you blink independently with your Arduino? How much current would that draw?
      </h4>
      <p>
        In theory, an Arduino Uno can control about 12-18 LEDs (D2 - D13 & A0 - A5). The current will be different based on the color of LED and resistor value i use, but if the LEDs are blinking independently (= if there's only one LED on at the time), the actual current draw would be the current of that LED only. <br> So from my assignment, because there's only one LED on at any given time, the current draw would be I = (5V - 2V) / 220Ω = 13.6mA.
      </p>
      <h4>
        3: How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking?
      </h4>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h4>
        4: Did you use AI tools in completing this assignment? If yes, please provide details on how/when, as well as a brief reflection. If no, you can either leave this question blank, or provide other information if you'd like.
      </h4>
      <p>
        Yes. I used ChatGPT to ask about HTML/CSS structures for specific styles that I wanted, since it has been a while since I took HCDE 310 and I had forgotten most of the syntax.
